About the Dataset:     
      1. size: 27.5MB         
      2. subfolder: Circle, Triangle, Square (with 10000 images in each)

Evaluation Metrics:

The model's performance was evaluated using the following metrics:
- Accuracy: The overall correctness of the classification.
- Precision: The ratio of correctly predicted instances to the total predicted instances for each class.
- Recall: The ratio of correctly predicted instances to the total actual instances for each class.
- F1-Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of model performance.
